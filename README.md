## This repo is for an analysis on the role of vagrant birds in birdwatching. The specific objectives are below.

### Objective 1.
quantify the number of rare birds and the numbers of birdwatchers who twitched them

### Objective 2.
probably will use 'distance travelled' and 'number of birders' as 'simple measures of value' (sensu Booth et al. 2011)

### Objective 3.
investigate whether vagrants were preferentially submitted to a broad-scale citizen science database

### Objective 4.
investigate whether birdwatchers contributed additional data to the citizen science database in addition to the rare bird.
